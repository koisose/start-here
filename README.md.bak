# What's This?

There's an auto-commit script located at [packages/scripts/commit.mjs](packages/scripts/commit.mjs). Place `GOOGLE_API_KEY=` in your `.env` file and run the auto-commit by executing `pnpm run commit`. This utilizes the Gemini Pro free version, which means Google will record all your input data for their training purposes. The commit message is translated to indonesian below the original commit message you can change the prompt to remove that.
